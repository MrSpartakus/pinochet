**Reviewer 1**

*  can contribute to literature on violence during regime transitions. The authors go on to state that literature on that topic is mainly qualitative. But there is quite a large and established quantitative literature highlighting the prevalence of violence in transition periods. It is a frequent pattern, for example, that periods of democratization are marred with violence (e.g. Hegre et al 2001 +++). What is new, I think, is therefore not the focus on violence during transitions, but individual level data on this violence. However, the author should also discuss the existence of similar datasets on other countries.
	- _Done in the abstract and introduction_

*  the authors can showcase some theoretical arguments concerning repression of opposition members during transitions and highlight how the data can be used to gain insights regarding these theories.
	- _Done in the introduction, paragraph 4_.

* But what are the limitations of the data the authors present? Surely, the data is also distorted, but in what ways and how does it affect the available data and the patterns discussed in the article? The authors mention two possible data problems on page 7, for example that former members of the regime refused to collaborate and the fact that the report's purpose was reconciliatory. Blanes (2005), as mentioned in the article, suggests that the number of omitted victims may be 40,000. How does that affect the data extracted from the reports? I do not mean to discount the value of the data with this comment---no data in the social science is complete---but I think it is necessary that the authors devote a section in the paper to discuss potential problems with the data, drawing on insights from previous work relying on similar reports to collect similar data. Are the problems related to the temporal and spatial components of the data? This would be extremely valuable for users of the data and scholars who plan to conduct similar data collection efforts in the future.

* The figures need to be changed to improve readability. The massive peak after the coup in 1973, for example, makes it impossible to see smaller spikes in the temporal graphs. Also, the decision to plot the entire American continent on the spatial plots makes it very difficult to see the spatial variation within Chile.

** Reviewer 2**

* This can be seen by the success of the disaggregated conflict studies literature, which might be the most vital and exciting area of quantitative international relations work.

* Why should I care about this particular case? The authors provide some explanation here but not enough in my mind. 

* I'd like to know more about the relative strengths and weaknesses of Chile under Pinochet as case. Does data on repression there and then allow us to test new theories or conduct better tests of existing theories? 

* What are the scope conditions that apply to empirical tests based on this data?

* The authors state that their data consist of 2,398 observations. I'd like to hear about the selection effects that lead to a case being reported in the Truth and Reconciliation reports. Are there reasons to be concerned about this? The authors seem to suggest that this is the case by noting that missingness might be related to some unknown covariate. What covariates should we be thinking about here?

* I like it when data papers use the described data to shed light on some important question within the field. I'd encourage the authors to do that in a revision.

* I'd like more discussion of covariate missingness. Why might observations lack information? For example, what is special (or not special) about the 19% of victims for which no geolocation is available?

* For the maps, why not just show Chile? Or, at least, just South America?

**Reviewer 3**

* But such a presentation already exists: in the TRC report itself. The authors refer to the report in general terms, but fail to mention the specific location of the quantitative analysis, in Tome 2, Annex VI.

* The Valech Report also includes a comprehensive statistical analysis, in addition to qualitative information on different cases. There are some minor discrepancies between the Rettig (1991) and the Valech (2004) reports, largely due to updated information on specific cases.

* Some authors have already used the quantitative data in the TRC report noted above, in some cases supplementing it with other data. The ms. mentions one of these authors (Huneeus), but ignores others, e.g.:

- Elías Padilla Ballesteros, La memoria y el olvido: Detenidos y desaparecidos en Chile (Santiago: Ediciones Orígenes, 1995)
- Robert Barros, Constitutionalism and Dictatorship: Pinochet, The Junta, and the 1980 Constitution (Cambridge University Press, 2002)
- Pablo Policzer, The Rise and Fall of Repression (Notre Dame University Press, 2009)

* One of the challenges this literature contends with, for example, is the difficulty in obtaining fine-grained data about what these regimes do where, when, and to whom (e.g. Jennifer Gandhi, Political Institutions under Dictatorship. Cambridge 2008; David Art "What do we Know About Authoritarianism After Ten Years," Comparative Politics April 2012). 

* It ignores a major analytical variable: political partisanship.

* The Rettig Report itself contains a comprehensive statistical analysis of the victims' political partisanship, and this information has already been used by some of the literature mentioned above analyzing the Chilean dictatorship (Padilla, Barros, Huneeus, Policzer).

*  It confusingly frames Chile as a case of civil war.
